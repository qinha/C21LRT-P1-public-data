Data for Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for P1 are available here.
Also, the line-continuum interaction plots (i.e. Figs. B3 and C1)

- Figure 1: Input reionisation history. We used EOS2021 (put the google drive link here) and the authors.
- Figure 2: line coefficients. 
- Figure 3, spectra with various turbulent velocities
- Figure 4, rest frame spectra at intermediate redshifts
- Figure 5, comparasion between 'optical depth' and C21LRT. All lines in the figure included.
- Figure B3 & C1, line-continuum interaction. Bottom panels included here.
